    <img id="mainimg" src="art.jpg" alt="cool art">

      <p>I want to capture a sort of space theme with this art I created.  The overall goal was to make something that could maybe even be used as a bakcground.  I am very proud of my work and I hope you find my art cool! (not actually my art its from a desktop backgroun website!!!!!!!) </p>
