    <h2>Offense</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg border border-info border-3 rounded p-2 m-1">
        <h3 class="display-5">QB: Ryan Tannehill</h3>
        <p>Going into his 3rd year with the team and 2nd season as the starter, Ryan Tannehill is poised to continue on the hotstreak he has set over the last 2 years in the NFL.  Having led the league in passer rating and 4th quarter combacks over the past 2 years, it can not be denied that he has overcome his billing as a bust and will be back to pilot the NFL's #4 scoring offense from 2020.</p>

      <div class="col-lg border border-info border-3 rounded p-2 m-1">
        <h3 class="display-5">HB: Derrick Henry</h3>
        <p>The NFL's reigning Offensive Player of the Year and the League's 5th highest leading rusher in the history of the NFL is back and ready for business in 2021.  Derrick Henry is will be 27 going into the season and normally this is when the wheels start to fall off for bellcow backs like Derrick Henry in the NFL.  Derrick Henry has defied all odds so far and I have a feeling he will continue that going into the 2021 season.</p>

      <div class="col-lg border border-info border-3 rounded p-2 m-1">
        <h3 class="display-5">HB: Darrynton Evans</h3>
        <p>The second year man out of App State was help out for most of the 2020 season with nagging injuries.  He did get some touches late in the year and showed some great flash.  This will be the season for him to prove he can be the electric 3rd down and recieving back that this offense could sorely use.  There are generally high hopes for Evans going into year 2 and for good reason! </p>

      <div class="col-lg border border-info border-3 rounded p-2 m-1">
        <h3 class="display-5">WR: AJ Brown</h3>
        <p>AJ Brown has consistently showed his greatness and ability after the catch throughout his first two NFL seasons.  Brown has solidly cemented himself as a top 12 reciever after a sophomore season that included 12 tds and his first pro bowl nod as well as a 2nd consecutive 1000 yard season.  AJ Brown is a boom or boom player and quickly established himself as Tannehill's top target.  Continue to expect great things from the man from Ole Miss. </p>

      <div class="col-lg border border-info border-3 rounded p-2 m-1">
        <h3 class="display-5">WR: Rookie/Free Agent</h3>
        <p>This is the first spot where the list starts to take a different turn.  The current players on the Titans roster for next year at the WR position truly just consists of AJ Brown.  This is an issue and will need to be fixed in the draft or free agency.  A couple options would be re-signing Corey Davis, Picking up Marvin Jones from the Lion, or drafting a young stud in the 1st or 2nd round (Rashod Bateman, Kadarius Toney, Elijah Moore, etc...) Stay tuned as this will be an intriguing area for the Titans this offseason. </p>

      <div class="col-lg border border-info border-3 rounded p-2 m-1">
        <h3 class="display-5">TE: Anthony Firkser?</h3>
        <p>With the Titans likely losing 2 year starter Jonnu Smith this offseason the TE room is most likely going to be shaken up.  The Tight End position has been an intersting spot on the roster since the departure of long time Titans great Delanie Walker.  Jonnu is clearly a great player but it seems the Titans would prefer to not pay a lot of money to a position that do not seem to utilize the same way as other offenses (49ers, Chiefs, Lions, etc...)  Expect long-time role player and typical role player Anthony Firkser to be the replacement for the 2021 season. </p>

      <div class="col-lg border border-info border-3 rounded p-2 m-1">
        <h3 class="display-5">LT: Taylor Lewan</h3>
        <p>The boy will finally be back in town.  After missing most of the 2020 season with a torn ACL the heart of the team will be back with a vengeance.  Taylor Lewan has been the long time stalwart on this offensive line and due to advancements in modern medicine I fully anticipate Lewan to be back to full health. The Titans had a long running issue with the left tackle spot this season and Lewan being back will put those worries to bed. </p>

      <div class="col-lg border border-info border-3 rounded p-2 m-1">
        <h3 class="display-5">LG: Rodger Saffold</h3>
        <p>Rodger Saffold is coming into his 3rd year on the Titans and has really showed to be a great player and leader after his unispiring starting stint with the Titans in 2019.  He took much harsh criticism but has quickly become possibly the best player on a Titans O-Line that is full of solid players. Saffold should continue his dominance even though he is getting up there in age.</p>

      <div class="col-lg border border-info border-3 rounded p-2 m-1">
        <h3 class="display-5">C: Ben Jones</h3>
        <p>Ben Jones has been the long time center for the Titans has been consistently solid, grading out generally favorably with PFF over the last 4-5 years.  The only issue is his contract and he looks like a possible cap casualty this year with hopes that 2nd year undrafted free agent from Texas State - Aaron Brewer can step into the job of starting center.  I still expect Ben Jones to be here but his release is certainly possible. </p>

      <div class="col-lg border border-info border-3 rounded p-2 m-1">
        <h3 class="display-5">RG: Nate Davis</h3>
        <p>The Right guard was previously help down by Quinton Spain, but the 3rd year player out of Charlotte has proven himself to be an absolute hog mollie in the run game.  Pushing and destroying D-lineman with ease.  His impressive development out of a small school should give the entire fanbase much optimism in Keith Carter's ability to develop O-line talent. Look for Davis to continue his impressive growth and a possible all-pro nod in 2021. </p>

      <div class="col-lg border border-info border-3 rounded p-2 m-1">
        <h3 class="display-5">RT: <del>Isaiah Wilson</del> Dennis Kelly</h3>
        <p>I love you Dennis.  I really do... but I really wish I was writing Isaiah Wilson's name here.  Dennis Kelly was acquired in a trade from the Philadelphia Eagles in 2016 and he has been a long time back-up turned starter out of necessity.  Dennis has become a solid if not below-average starter for the Titans and he does get the job done.  But after letting our 1st team all-pro RT go in the previous season we drafted Isaiah Wilson higly to be groomed to be the replacement.  Let's just say his development and time on the team has been...turbulent.  Dennis Kelly should be back this year on the 2nd year of his 3 year contract. </p>

      <div class="col-lg border border-info border-3 rounded p-2 m-1">
        <h3 class="display-5">DE: Rookie/Free Agent</h3>
        <p>Edge is a role that the Titans have consistently failed at supporting for the last several years.  With nobody impressive to speak of other than Harold Landry in 2019, The Titans edge position has been a barren wasteland.  The Titans NEED to pick up someone in the offseason that can put it together and stay healthy.  We don't need another vic beasley and it seems the Clowney experiment has failed.  Look for some late 1st round pick guys such as Gregory Rosseau, Carlos Basham and Kwity Paye to be possible draft picks.  Carl Lawson from Ciniccinati is a another intriguing free agency option.</p>

      <div class="col-lg border border-info border-3 rounded p-2 m-1">
        <h3 class="display-5">DT: Jeffrey Simmons</h3>
        <p>Big Jeff Simmons (there has to be a better nickname out there) was likely the best player on the Titans pourous defense of 2020.  Jeff Simmons started off extremely and leveled off throughout the season due to consistently high usage and not much depth around him.  Jeffery was our 2019 1st round draft pick and don't look for him to be going anywhere.  If the Titans are able to get any consistent help for Simmons off the edge, look for his stats and recognition to skyrocket in 2021.</p>
      </div> <!-- close column -->

      <div class="col-lg border border-info border-3 rounded p-2 m-1">
        <h3 class="display-5">NT: DaQuan Jones</h3>
        <p> DaQuan Jones has been a long time starter for the Titans on the Defensive line and a captain as well as of 2020.  Jones is one of the better Nose Tackles in the league (a dying position) but his presence is important and felt.  It is possible that Jones does not return for the 2021 season on the Titans (expiring contract) but due to positional value the expectation is to retain him.  If he does bow out, look for 2020 undrafted rookie Teair Tart from FIU to take over.  Tart got some work in 2020 and impressed a great deal. </p>

      <div class="col-lg border border-info border-3 rounded p-2 m-1">
        <h3 class="display-5">LB: Rashaan Evans</h3>
        <p>After a somewhat promising rookie and sophmore campaign...Evans did not live up to his development in his Junior Season.  Evans is coming off his worst season as a pro after being deemed the "prodigal son" by Head Coach Mike Vrabel in his first 2 seasons in the league.  (Vrabel former superbowl winner and all-pro linebacker).  Evans was out of position more often than not in the 2020 season and it is looking like his 5th year option available only to 1st round picks will not be picked up for the 2022 season.  Hopes are that Evans is able to bounce back in his 4th year in the league. </p>

      <div class="col-lg border border-info border-3 rounded p-2 m-1">
        <h3 class="display-5">LB: Harold Landry</h3>
        <p>Harold Landry is a player that showed nothing but potential but I believe he has been a product of simply being overworked in the pass rush game and put out of position when he does have to cover TEs and RBs.  Landry has player over 90% of snaps over his 3 years in the league which is simply unheard of for edge rushers in this league.  Landry needs a reliever and he simply does not have that right now.  The hope is this will be addressed in the offseason and Landry can finally grow into his true potential.</p>

        <h3 class="display-5">LB: Free Agent/Rookie</h3>
        <p>The other offball linebacker spot/edge rusher.  With standout 4 - year linebacker Jayon Brown looking to be paid in the offseason it is likely that rounding out our front 6/7 will be paramount in the offseason.  Promising 3rd year man - David Long Jr. from West Virginia is certainly a candidate to take this position.  He plays a very similar game to Jayon Brown.</p>

        <h3 class="display-5">CB: Adoree' Jackson</h3>
        <p>Action Jackson was sorely missed in the 2020 season when the Titans trotted out one of the worst defenses in franchise and NFL history.  Jackson was continuosly sidelines with a knee injury and finally saw action towards the end of the season, though it was poor.  With hoepfully a full offseason to rest up and get healthy Adoree' should be able to get back to form as a top 10 CB in the NFL which he proved after his Junior campaign in 2019.  We are going into a contract year for Jackson and we would like to be impressed just as much as he wants to be impressive.</p>

        <h3 class="display-5">CB: Malcolm Butler</h3>
        <p>I have frequently flip-floped on keeping or cutting Malcolm Butler but my belief is 2nd round pick from 2020, Kristian Fulton will not be ready to start next year and Malcolm Butler was easily our best player in the defesnive backfield, leading the team in all major statistical DB categories.  A restructure would make keeping his 12 million dollar cap hit a lot more pallatable and I expect it to happen this offseason.</p>

        <h3 class="display-5">FS: Kevin Byard</h3>
        <p>The former first team all-pro did not look to be his normal self in 2020.  He played overall bad football and a lot can be attributed to scheme but it also may be possible that Byard is already beginning his descent into getting too old.  (Turning 28 when the season starts.)  Having Kevin Byard back to form as a league leader in interceptions, tackles, and passes defensed would be huge for the titans that was a bottom 5 passing defense in the NFL.</p>

        <h3 class="display-5">SS: Amani Hooker</h3>
        <p>3rd year man out of Iowa played his most meaningful minutes in the 2020 season and while he was not always great he was almost always a acceptable and acceptable may have well have been great for the Titans in the 2020 season.  The current starter at this position (Kenny Vaccaro) is still signed for the next 2 years with close to 0 guarenteed money left on his contract.  Vacarro came to the Titans at a critical time and his defensive presence was great but it is believed it is time to part ways.  (For salary cap purposes as well as getting a promising young player out on the field.)</p>

      <div class="col-lg border border-info border-3 rounded p-2 m-1">
        <h3 class="display-5">DB: Desmond King</h3>
        <p>This is something I personally am hoping for more than expecting.  The titans run a lot of nickel, it's basically the base for most of the league as this point but having a player like Desmond King (acquired for a 5th round pick from the chargers at the trade deadline this year) in the system for another year would be great for the Titans.  He liked the city, he liked his teammates, and he loved the fans.  Gettting King into a competent defensive scheme where his traits are best used would be key but I have faith in the former all-pro to rise to the challenge if he were to stick around in Nashville.</p>
